                <h2>5 Tips on How to Quit Smoking</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Some individuals will find it more difficult to quit smoking than others. Show yourself grace along the way and keep trying. Many times, it can take several attempts to successfully quit smoking.</p>
                <p>There are many resources to support you along the way. Consider enlisting the help of friends and family to keep you encouraged and hold you accountable as you quit smoking.</p>
                <p>It also helps to pinpoint the reasons you want to quit. Whether you want to live longer, age better, or have more energy to run around with your kids, figure out your “why” for quitting smoking to help keep you motivated.</p>
                <p><b><i>Here are 5 of the best tips to help quit smoking.</i></b></p>

            <section>
                <h3>1. Use a Reward System</h3>
                <p>Consider rewarding yourself for milestones when you quit smoking. Set time frames and days where you can enjoy a reward when you reach that mark of no smoking (i.e one day of no smoking, two days, a week, a month, etc.). Rewards can increase as you reach each milestone.</p>
                <p>There are even online calculators that let you figure out exactly how much money you’ll save smoking. Consider using this money to reward yourself with something fun.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>2. Hypnosis</h3>
                <p>There are many potential <a href="https://stellarhypnotherapy.com.au/what-is-hypnotherapy-and-15-ways-it-can-change-your-life/"><u> benefits of hypnotherapy</u></a>, including help for quitting smoking.</p>
                <p><a href="https://stellarhypnotherapy.com.au/quit-smoking/"><u> Hypnosis to quit smoking</u></a> can help address the root cause of your addiction and equip you with the tools needed to live a smoke-free life.</p>
                <p>Hypnosis to quit smoking is a safe and drug-free approach to easing the irritability, nicotine cravings, and withdrawal symptoms that often accompany the quitting process. Hypnotherapy for smoking cessation can help bring about lasting change and long-term success all in a safe, drug-free manner. A Clinical Hypnotherapist can give you the tools needed to empower you to quit smoking for good.</p>

                <h3>4. Practice Relaxation Techniques</h3>
                <p>Many people find that the nicotine in cigarettes helps them relax. This means you’ll need new methods to unwind once you quit.</p>
                <p><i>Here are some natural ways to feel more relaxed as you quit smoking:</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listen to your favourite music</li>
                    <li>Practice self-care (a hot bath, a massage, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Make time for your favourite hobbies</li>
                    <li>Avoid stressful situations as much as possible, especially during the first few weeks of quitting</li>

                <h3>5. Avoid Potential Triggers</h3>
                <p>Certain habits and actions can trigger your urge to have a cigarette. To help you quit smoking, pay attention to these triggers and try to limit or avoid them entirely.</p>
                <p><i>Here are some areas to pay attention to:</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you find that drinking alcohol increases your urge to smoke? If so, limit your alcohol intake, especially when you are first trying to quit.</li>
                    <li>Do you have a cigarette with your coffee every morning? Try switching to tea for the first few weeks as you try to quit.</li>
                    <li>Do you smoke after meals? Choose another habit instead (i.e. taking a walk, brushing your teeth, chewing gum, having a cup of tea, talking with a friend)</li>
                    <li>When you decide to quit, toss any lighters and ashtrays</li>
                    <li>Upon quitting, wash anything that smells like smoke (drapes, carpets, sheets, clothes, upholstery)</li>
                    <li>Use air fresheners or candles to help get rid of any lingering smoke smells</li>
                    <li>If you smoked in your car, give it a thorough cleaning</li>
                </ul>
